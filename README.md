## Meow Meow Milkshake
"Meow Meow Milshake" is a browser game created using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. As new coders, we wanted to challenge ourselves with a game and we decided that we should make a cozy cooking simulator. Our original idea was to create a world where all humans were gone and cats had taken over. Now you work as a pawrista at a local milkshake bar. 

## Description
Meow Meow Milkshake is a cute and whimsical cooking simulator game for gamers and non-gamers alike. Our goal is to provide users with a cute and wholesome experince of creating a varitey of milkshakes for a diverse cast of cat customers. 


## Development and Purpose

During our development process, we adopted agile methodolgy, which allowed us to work efficiently and respond to any changes or feedback. We began with deciding various interfaces like the Loading Screen, Selection Screen, Cafe Screen, and the Serving Scren while organizing and creating user stories. We catorgorized the user stories by its priority level and the amount of work (Small, Medium, Large task and Must/Should/Could/Won't tasks). We also created a mission statement, a success slider, our team charter, and our vision for what we want to create. For each user story we outlined a definition and acceptance critia and broke them into sprint tasks. For every three weeks (each sprint period), we designated time to work on tasks. Each sprint began with a planning session and a stand up meeting where we discussed our user stories and our progress. We also got input from eachother and implemented to meet our user needs and expectations. We also maintained a Team Metrics page and our own Activity Report.

During class, we also held sprint reviews with other groups and communicated with our scrum master. We would showcase our features and enchancements that we works on. We gathered a lot of valuable input and it helped us to move our project in the right direction. 

The purpose of developing 'Meow Meow Milkshake' was to challenge ourselves and to create a viable product. We wanted to explore new technologies, develop new team collaboration skills, and refine our coding ability. For UI/UX, we wanted them to have an accessible, easy, and charming experience. We hope to appeal to a broad audience and that they immerse themsleves in joy while creating milkshakes for their cat customers! 

## Tools
We used a variety of tools including:
- Microsoft 365
- Visual Studio Code
- Replit
- Gitlab
- Discord
- Medibang
- IArtbook

We used these tools to maximize collaboration, document managment, coding, version control, and creating graphical and artistic graphs.

## Programming Languages
We used a varitey of programming languages including:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Usage
For our game, we imagined the users to play our game during their free time. We wanted to provide them with a fun experience for both people who are familiar and less familiar with new games. 
We wanted it to help with memory and attention span via the ordering system and to provide users with a whimscal and enjoyable experience.

## Project status
As we reach the end of CI103, we are trying our best to finish our porject and make it a functionally MVP. We have been slowing down a bit because we have worked a lot during CI102 and the beginning of CI103 so we do not have as many tasks and things to do left.

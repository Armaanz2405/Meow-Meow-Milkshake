## Meow Meow Milkshake
"Meow Meow Milshake" is a browser game created using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. As new coders, we wanted to challenge ourselves with a game and we decided that we should make a cozy cooking simulator. Our original idea was to create a world where all humans were gone and cats had taken over. Now you work as a pawrista at a local milkshake bar. We planned to add a story but we wanted functionality and gameplay before anything else. 

## Description
Our project focuses on creating orders based on a randomized milkshake order. 

We organized and propitized certain interfaces like the Loading Screen, Selection Screen, Cafe Screen, and Serving Screen while creating user stories. We sorted the user stories by their priority level and amount of work (Small, Medium, Large task and a Must/Should/Could/Wont.
For each US we wrote acceptable criteria and broke them into sprint tasks. Each sprint, a period of three weeks we would focus on  



Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Project status
As we reach the end of CI103, we are trying our best to finish our porject and make it a functionally MVP. We have been slowing down a bit because we have worked a lot during CI102 and the beginning of CI103 so we do not have as many tasks and things to do left.

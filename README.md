## Meow Meow Milkshake
"Meow Meow Milshake" is a browser game created using HTML, Javascript, and CSS. As new coders, we wanted to challenge ourselves with a game and we decided that we should make a cozy cooking simulator. Our original idea was to create a world where all humans were gone and cats had taken over. Now you work as a pawrista at a local milkshake bar. 

## Description
Meow Meow Milkshake is a cute and whimsical cooking simulator game for gamers and non-gamers alike. Our goal is to provide users with a cute and wholesome experince of creating a varitey of milkshakes for a diverse cast of cat customers.

## Project status
As we reach the end of CI103, we are trying our best to finish our porject and make it a functionally MVP. We have been slowing down a bit because we have worked a lot during CI102 and the beginning of CI103 so we do not have as many tasks and things to do left.
